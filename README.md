# Anime-Face-Generation-using-DCGAN

To make it possible for an Anime Face Generation, we used the technology of DCGAN-deep convolutional generative adversarial networks. Our ultimate goal was to train a complex deep learning model which independently followed the process of creating the top-notch anime faces. In order to accomplish this, an impressive dataset composed of about 63,632 anime face images was attentively gathered and applied for training tasks. And this dataset was sources from kaggle's Anime Face Dataset.


That project focused first and foremost on ameliorating the crucial parts of the architecture of the DCGAN, which are the discriminator and the generator networks. The loop of this network was perfected in the sense that the resultant faces were of high quality and a wide variety emerged. The outcome was a model gaining considerable upper hand during the process as it presented humanlike faces of great variability and therefore created a landmark in the sphere of AI-powered anime character creation.
